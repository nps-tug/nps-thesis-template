NPS LaTeX Thesis Template
=========================

This is the "officially" supported LaTeX template
for NPS theses and technical reports. It is
based on style files originally modified by Simson Garfinkel
for this purpose.

Documentation
-------------
A very well-written technical report describing how to use the
template can be found under `doc/NPS-CS-11-011.pdf`. Note that this
report was drafted relative to an earlier version of the template, and may
not be entirely up-to-date with the current version.

Status
------
For each release, the reports under `examples/` will be tested and then vetted 
through the thesis processing office. The following options are supported:

* theses for dual degrees (two degrees, two departments, two chairs)
* FOUO marking for theses and dissertations
* theses and disserations, with the following options:

|  Author | Advisor | Reader | Type   |
|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1       | 1       | 1      | thesis |
| 1       | 1       | 2      | thesis |
| 1       | 2       | -      | thesis |
| 1       | 2       | 1      | thesis |
| 2       | 1       | 1      | thesis |
| 2       | 2       | -      | thesis |
| 2       | 2       | 1      | thesis |
| 1       | 5       | -      | dissertation |
| 1       | 6       | -      | dissertation |


### Experimental 
These were thought to work properly earlier, but not recently tested / vetted:

* Classified marking for theses and disserations


Development
-----------
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nps-tug/nps-thesis-template) 
for this template is for maintenance and development.
It is being maintained there, in an attempt to simplify and consolidate
improvement efforts for the template, which previously were distributed
across a small community, maintaining their own local versions of the template.
