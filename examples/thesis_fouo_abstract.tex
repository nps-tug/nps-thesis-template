% CHAPTERS
% You have two options on how to structure your thesis:
% a) A single file. All chapters, sections, etc. go in this file.
%    This can make navigating your thesis a little more difficult.
% b) Use multiple files.  One chapter per file is recommended.
%    This breaks your thesis up into logical units to edit.
%
\input{chapter_fouo_marking}
\input{chapter1}
%
% (include other chapters here...)
%


% APPENDICES
% You have two recommended options for your appendix:
% a) A single appendix (with a single TOC entry)
% b) Multiple appendices. Look under the examples directory for a demo of
%   multiple appendices.
