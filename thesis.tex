% This starts the document; the "npsreport" style is really a modified
% report style. Feel free to use the options explained in the technical
% report NPS-CS-11-011, included under the doc/ directory.
\documentclass[twoside,thesis]{npsreport}

%
% Put extra packages you may need to customize your thesis
%
\usepackage{doc,lipsum} % provides \BibTex and \lipsum macros, for demos

%
% For Example: you might find one of these useful:

%\usepackage{epstopdf}        % to use .eps files for figures
%\usepackage{bm}              % bold math if you need bold greek letters
%\usepackage{glossaries}      % see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
%\usepackage{asymptote}       % for graphics
% The asymptote package allows for very nice graphics and figures
% Proper usage requires additional information located at:
% http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/
% See the gallery at this URL for examples

%\usepackage{placeins}        % float placement
% Provides \FloatBarrier which keeps figures/tables in the same section.
% LaTeX sometimes moves them to fill up pages.
% http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/placeins/placeins-doc.pdf

%\usepackage[numbered]{mcode} % matlab code
% The mcode package must be separately downloaded.
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8015-m-code-latex-package

%\usepackage{flafter}         % float placement
% Ensures that figures/tables do not appear in the document before
% they are referenced in the text.

% CHAPTERS
% You have two options on how to structure your thesis:
% a) A single file. All chapters, sections, etc. go in this file.
%    This can make navigating your thesis a little more difficult.
% b) Use multiple files.  One chapter per file is recommended.
%    This breaks your thesis up into logical units to edit.
%
\input{chapter1}
%
% (include other chapters here...)
%


% APPENDICES
% You have two recommended options for your appendix:
% a) A single appendix (with a single TOC entry)
% b) Multiple appendices. Look under the examples directory for a demo of
%   multiple appendices.
