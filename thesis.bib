This is an example bib file, that flexes most of the capabilities
of the .bst file. These examples are taken from the example .bib
from the IEEEtran package: 
http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/

If you do not reference a bibliographic entry in your thesis,
it will not be put into your references. Thus, you may keep these
example entries in your file for reference. Of, you may delete everything
between the "START" and "END" comments, and start a fresh bib file.

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.

book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

standard with type and revision, the type overrides the word standard
(or std.). Here a standard number is not available and a revision number
is used.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1048, reference #13.
@standard{IEEEexample:standardproposed,
  title         = "Fiber Channel Physical Interface ({FC-PI})",
  institution   = "NCITS",
  address       = "Washington, DC",
  type          = "Working Draft Proposed Standard",
  revision      = "5.2",
  year          = "1999"
}


standard draft as a misc with author
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in
Communication", page 725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:draftasmisc,
  author        = "I. Widjaja and A. Elwalid",
  title         = "{MATE}: {MPLS} Adaptive Traffic Engineering",
  howpublished  = "IETF Draft",
  year          = "1999"
}


misc for a techreport like reference
techreport is not perfectly suitable because this entry lacks
an institution field
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 490, reference #22.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscforum,
  author        = "L. Roberts",
  title         = "Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm {PRCA}",
  howpublished  = "{ATM} Forum Contribution 94-0735R1",
  month         = aug,
  year          = "1994"
}


misc for a white paper
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 478, reference #4 - Note that the reference there (improperly?)
used the author field for "Cisco".
@misc{IEEEexample:whitepaper,
  title         = "Advanced {QoS} Services for the Intelligent Internet",
  howpublished  = "White Paper",
  organization  = "Cisco",
  month         = may,
  year          = "1997"
}


misc for a data sheet
From the November 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1551, reference #6.
@misc{IEEEexample:datasheet,
  title         = "{PDCA12-70} Data Sheet",
  organization  = "Opto Speed SA",
  address       = "Mezzovico, Switzerland"
}


a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"
}


an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",
  howpublished  = "RFC 2481",
  month         = jan,
  year          = "1999"
}


a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.
@manual{IEEEexample:softmanual,
  title         = "SaberDesigner Reference Manual",
  organization  = "Analogy, Inc.",
  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns",
  version       = "2",
  date          = "n.d.",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"
}


misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in
Communication", page 892, reference #9.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscgermanreg,
  title         = "{M}essung von {S}t{\"o}rfeldern an {A}nlagen 
                   und {L}eitungen der {T}elekommunikation im
                   {F}requenzbereich 9 {kHz} bis 3 {GHz}",
  language      = "german",
  howpublished  = "{M}e{\ss}vorschrift {R}eg {TP} {MV} 05",
  organization  = "Regulierungsbeh{\"o}rde f{\"u}r {T}elekommunikation und
                   {P}ost ({R}eg {TP})"
}


Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}
