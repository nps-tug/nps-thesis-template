This is an example bib file, that flexes most of the capabilities
of the .bst file. These examples are taken from the example .bib
from the IEEEtran package: 
http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/bibtex/

If you do not reference a bibliographic entry in your thesis,
it will not be put into your references. Thus, you may keep these
example entries in your file for reference. Of, you may delete everything
between the "START" and "END" comments, and start a fresh bib file.

The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.

year is required, so if absent, use the year field to hold
the "accepted for publication" in order to avoid a warning for
the missing year field.

  year          = "1992"
}


book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

technical report, standards submission report
From the June 2004 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications",
page 928, reference #9.
Note that some journals do not abbreviate the task group: "TGe" => "Task Group E"
@techreport{IEEEexample:techrepstdsub,

an unpublished work
for unpublished types, the note field is required. IEEE usually
just uses the word "unpublished" for the note.
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 391, reference #16.
@unpublished{IEEEexample:unpublished,
  author        = "T. J. Ott and N. Aggarwal",

electronic with an organization and address
From the February 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 114, reference #15.
@electronic{IEEEexample:electronorgadd,

}


U.S. patent
Use the type field to override the patent type. e.g.,
type = "Patent Application"
The address is that of the assignee. Note that IEEE does not
display the assignee, the address, and only displays one date.
(if year is not present, the filed dates are used.) However, this
information should be entered as other BibTeX styles may use it.
alternatively, nationality could be entered as "U.S." 
From the April 2000 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 542, reference #6.
@patent{IEEEexample:uspat,
  author        = "Ronald E. Sorace and Victor S. Reinhardt and
                   Steven A. Vaughn",
  assignee      = "Hughes Aircraft Company",
  address       = "Los Angeles, CA",
  title         = "High-Speed Digital-to-{RF} Converter",
  nationality   = "United States",

  dayfiled      = "28",
  monthfiled    = feb,
  yearfiled     = "1995",
  day           = "16",
  month         = sep,
  year          = "1997"
}


Japanese Patent
From the April 2000 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 556, reference #6.
@patent{IEEEexample:jppat,
  author        = "U. Hideki",
  title         = "Quadrature Modulation Circuit",
  nationality   = "Japanese",
  number        = "152932/92",
  day           = "20",
  month         = may,
  year          = "1992"
}


French Patent request, the language field must be entered in lower case
as this is the option name Babel uses. The nationality field needs to be
capitalized. Because this is a patent request, the date filed fields are
used while the date fields are left empty/missing. In other countries,
the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.
From the April 2000 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 556, reference #9.
@patent{IEEEexample:frenchpatreq,
  author        = "F. Kowalik and M. Isard",
  title         = "Estimateur d'un D{\'e}faut de Fonctionnement 
                   d'un Modulateur en Quadrature et {\'E}tage de Modulation

  dayfiled      = "11",
  monthfiled    = jan,
  yearfiled     = "1995"
}


standard, IEEE does not use the address for standards, but it is good
to provide one for BibTeX styles that use it.
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 451, reference #2.
@standard{IEEEexample:standard,
  title         = "Wireless {LAN} Medium Access Control {(MAC)} and 
                   Physical Layer {(PHY)} Specification",
  organization  = "IEEE",
  address       = "Piscataway, NJ",
  number        = "802.11",
  year          = "1997"
}


standard with type and revision, the type overrides the word standard
(or std.). Here a standard number is not available and a revision number
is used.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1048, reference #13.
@standard{IEEEexample:standardproposed,
  title         = "Fiber Channel Physical Interface ({FC-PI})",
  institution   = "NCITS",
  address       = "Washington, DC",
  type          = "Working Draft Proposed Standard",
  revision      = "5.2",
  year          = "1999"
}


standard draft as a misc with author
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in
Communication", page 725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:draftasmisc,
  author        = "I. Widjaja and A. Elwalid",
  title         = "{MATE}: {MPLS} Adaptive Traffic Engineering",
  howpublished  = "IETF Draft",
  year          = "1999"
}


misc for a techreport like reference
techreport is not perfectly suitable because this entry lacks
an institution field
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 490, reference #22.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscforum,
  author        = "L. Roberts",
  title         = "Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm {PRCA}",
  howpublished  = "{ATM} Forum Contribution 94-0735R1",
  month         = aug,
  year          = "1994"
}


misc for a white paper
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 478, reference #4 - Note that the reference there (improperly?)
used the author field for "Cisco".
@misc{IEEEexample:whitepaper,
  title         = "Advanced {QoS} Services for the Intelligent Internet",
  howpublished  = "White Paper",
  organization  = "Cisco",
  month         = may,
  year          = "1997"
}


misc for a data sheet
From the November 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1551, reference #6.
@misc{IEEEexample:datasheet,
  title         = "{PDCA12-70} Data Sheet",
  organization  = "Opto Speed SA",
  address       = "Mezzovico, Switzerland"
}


a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"
}


an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",
  howpublished  = "RFC 2481",
  month         = jan,
  year          = "1999"
}


a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.
@manual{IEEEexample:softmanual,
  title         = "SaberDesigner Reference Manual",
  organization  = "Analogy, Inc.",
  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns (Version 2)",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"
}


misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in
Communication", page 892, reference #9.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscgermanreg,
  title         = "{M}essung von {S}t{\"o}rfeldern an {A}nlagen 
                   und {L}eitungen der {T}elekommunikation im
                   {F}requenzbereich 9 {kHz} bis 3 {GHz}",
  language      = "german",
  howpublished  = "{M}e{\ss}vorschrift {R}eg {TP} {MV} 05",
  organization  = "Regulierungsbeh{\"o}rde f{\"u}r {T}elekommunikation und
                   {P}ost ({R}eg {TP})"
}


Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}

a class notes example.
@misc{NPSexample:notes,
  title         = "Signal integrity and interconnects for high-speed applications",
  organization  = "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
                   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign",
  howpublished  = "class notes for ECE497-JS",
  year          = "Winter 1997"
}
